        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p>The breadth of literature involved supplies context on the significance of the study. Sources supplied serve to exemplify the repeat pattern of loneliness and social manipulation in cults alongside the prevalence of individualism-induced loneliness in North America. Before conducting the research, a foundation of applicable psychological and sociological texts will need to be involved in placing the foundation theory and highlighting the knowledge gap. Though much writing exists on the matter, the study itself aims to draw the connection between the two through a qualitative understanding.</p>

                Regarding individualism, Allik & Realo (2004) supply a relevant measure for individualism with comparison to other countries. Thus, providing an accurate measurement for the variable of individualism in North America. Furthering the argument of loneliness, Heu, van Zomeren, & Hansen (2018) argue that individuals become more dependent on society as a result of individualist or collectivist cultural leanings. Their 2018 study collected data in multiple different countries and measured testimony regarding loneliness for participants in either individualist or collectivist cultures; understanding how individualism created a dependence on social environments rather than collectivist shows how loneliness manifests as a vulnerability. Sadhu (2012) argues that feeling disconnected and isolated is a growing concern in modern North American culture, which has lost its a sense of community. Loneliness is a pervasive issue in North America where we see our lack of communal bonding and familial strength as self-sufficiency. The question then begs, what are we risking in this pursuit of idealized independence?</p>

                <p>"She was deeply lonely and at one point seriously considered taking her own life" states Dickinson (2019) regarding Nicole, an ex-member of the NXIVM cult. Loneliness is a repeating occurrence in interviews on cult defector psychological states. Sources such as Dickinson's provide proof that loneliness is a pervasive issue among the groups and could benefit from further investigation. Additionally, the majority of participants in Coates (2012) became committed members of their group due to the friendships and connections their cult provided. Social integration of cult collectivist environments entices those seeking personal connections they may be lacking elsewhere. Cults facilitate these relationships by socializing vulnerable individuals into the cultural milieu of the sect (Walsh, 2001). From here, that dependency on other members reinforces the reliance on communal space and fear of the non-integrated world. In Rousselet (2017), deeply rooted social ties such as family members, romantic relationships, dependence on the group, or affinities between cult members inhibit exiting the sect. Therefore, a cure to loneliness incentivizes initial membership while the communal group experience exacerbates in-group dependency; weakening the ability to leave. Diane Lake, a former Charles Manson disciple, is quoted stating, "I immediately knew I wanted to be a part of it… For the first time in my life… my loneliness [was] disappearing" during an interview on her experience with the Manson family cult (Morrison, 2019).</p>
