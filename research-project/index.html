        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>As North American society has evolved into one that sees individualism as a value, there also exists the sacrifices made in a culture that prides itself on perceived self-sufficiency. The sociological and psychological impacts that arise from loneliness can manifest as feelings of isolation that leave vulnerable populations open to indoctrination as they seek a sense of community. The research conducted will explore the possible connection between individualism in society and susceptibility to cult tactics.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As cults remain a relevant issue, understanding what outside factors could be enabling cult tactics is pressing in nature. In our current political climate with the many conspiracy groups, far-right extremist movements, and sex cults like NXIVM converting business ventures into sex slavery, the current state of affairs requires us to look beyond placing the onus of responsibility on those personally involved. With loneliness often being a factor in influencing people to join, and the social integration making exiting difficult, the human need for companionship becomes an integral component of the cult experience. My hypothesis theorizes that individualism, as a contributing factor to loneliness, causes people to seek out more integrated communal experiences regardless of the risks involved.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Studying this hypothesis will consist of case studies on the emotional and psychological feelings of those involved in two prominent cults in North America, Scientology and NXIVM, to be used as representative cases. The aim is to understand the testimony from those involved and contextualize it using supplemental theory and texts regarding the relationship between loneliness and individualism. The study will be conducted by myself through my undergraduate studies. The scope of the project involves using informant testimony and oral history from trustworthy sources and sorting it thematically and chronologically to examine its practical relevance.</p>
