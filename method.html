        <h2>Methodology and Methods</h2>
        <p>Diane Lake is just one example in the multitude of interviews conducted with cult defectors and members. With secrets abundant in these membership-only sects, personal testimony is often one of the few methods which researchers can learn of those involved on a qualitative basis. Due to this, a case study of looking through various interview texts from ex-cult members from NXIVM and Scientology alongside cult recruitment artefacts will help display practical examples of the relationship of loneliness influencing cult membership. Using the interpretive paradigm to examine testimony texts for overlooked factors, we can hope to find new learnings on why a communal environment would entice a person so strongly.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Understanding the enticement factor will allow us to draw a possible connection. A repeat pattern of people merging with a cult for the benefit of a collectivist lifestyle indicates the problem being a lack of collective experience in the non-affiliated world. Supplanting this pattern alongside quantitative data and theory on the prevalence of growing loneliness and individualism in North America suggests a clear connection. The vulnerabilities of those living in Western Society are an essential issue as manipulation and abuse remain abundant in cults.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Claims involved will be descriptive, interpretive, and explanatory. Descriptive claims will consist of the correlation data between loneliness and individualism, as well as the prevalence of individualism in the United States. Interpretive claims will focus on the humanistic component of testimony from ex-cult members speaking on their experience. Explanatory claims will seek to draw a valuable connection between the data involving individualistic loneliness and collectivist incentives from cult living through a relationship model. These claims in a case study analysis of NXIVM and Scientology, as two prominent and modern cults, will hope to yield transferrable findings.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Though findings in this research are a vital component, the study will follow the Nuremberg code to ensure the consent, respect, and safety should any human subjects become involved (McIntyre, 2005, p. 77). Human subjects will not have direct involvement; therefore, the main ethical concern will be the confidentiality of subjects from the texts. Any subject names from private research will be kept confidential for their privacy.</p>

            <p>The methodology of this project is structured around respect for those involved with a concern for their well-being. Researchers will take a non-judgemental approach that's purely qualitative will be undertaken. This study aims to protect those who may be at at-risk of cult luring tactics and better understand the socio-cultural factors beyond their control. By understanding the sensitive nature of victims involves the study will undertake a focus on transferrable data findings with strict ethical parameters involved.</p>
