        <h2>Project Plan and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Using the ethical framework and methodological reasoning addressed, the project conducted will be a small-scale investigation throughout my undergraduate studies. To explore the connection between societal individualism and cult membership, the case study will involve peer-reviewed scholarly research supplemented by gathered testimony from primary sources alongside material artefacts. Following this, relevant hypotheses will structure the analytical goals for interpreting the available texts and artefacts. The theoretical elements chosen will involve only trusted works from consummate professionals in their field that pass the credibility testing, giving a sturdy foundation to the case study. Further, the use of primary sources will best investigate the subjects through their testimony without secondary interpretation.</p>

            <br>
            <p>To gather relevant data, the research team will incorporate sources from the International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) and request access to a repository of Cult Awareness Network (CAN) texts and artefacts. Data gathered will be informants and their oral history as well as material artefacts such as recruitment documents or manifestos. To establish reliability and credibility of the data and interpretations, I will use an audit trail that will keep a record of documents referenced. The source's representativeness and adequacy exhibit itself through use of prominent cults that are recent and densely populated, instead of niche sects. Researchers will organize data chronologically and thematically to avoid any inconsistencies in logic to maintain data coherence.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The study will set in place a project plan to accomplish this coherence and reliability. The propaganda model in <i>Manufacturing Consent</i> by Herman and Chomsky (1988) serves as an example of a guiding organizational framework for practical applications of theory; starting by laying the theoretical foundation and then follows several case studies. The study conducted will begin with reading relevant literature to establish the foundation of the arguments to study. Afterwards, specific hypotheses to be tested will be recorded as they will set the direction of the texts analyzed. Using the credible sources of the ICSA and CAN, hypotheses will be tested through the artefacts and recorded testimony found. Themes researched will consist of disillusionment with contemporary society, isolation, feelings of loneliness, and the communal experience cults offer.  Data discovered will then be organized into chronology and thematic clusters to construct a narrative. This narrative will guide the discussion following the research undertaken. Final results will consist of a timeline of various participants personal experiences both inside and outside of cults as well as messages conveyed in materials distributed by cult members.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Difficulties may arise due to the limited availability of sources. Cult involvement is a sensitive and private topic to study. Due to this nature, we will need permissions to access information and to maintain positive relationships with references. Respect and transparency are essential for the study to maintain integrity in its relationships with ICSA and CAN for their consensual participation. There also remains the issue of accessibility to the source documents themselves. Documents may not be accessible to an unaffiliated, undergraduate researcher such as me and there could be issues in requesting access. Additionally, the testimony yielded from past interviews may be limited as no one may have probed with the relevant questions.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Despite the potential for skewed data or unverifiable results, there remains value in trying to search for answers using the data available. Following this model within the timeline provided can provide a starting point for further probing on the issue. The goal is to uncover a gap in the existing knowledge pool regarding cult vulnerability. Using the plan, as mentioned earlier, the goal is to both uncover any possible connections and start a dialogue on the socio-cultural factors that may affect the susceptibility of a nation to manipulation.</p>
